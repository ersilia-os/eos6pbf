    "Description": "String representation of small molecules that is more robust than SMILES, since, by design, all SELFIES strings are valid molecules. It is particularly helpful when applied in generative models, as all the SELFIES proposed are valid molecules. The authors also found that on generative models, SELFIES produces more diverse molecules than compared to SMILES.",
